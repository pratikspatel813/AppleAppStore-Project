# Apple App Store Project
This is a data analysis project about app in the Apple App Store. 

## Background
Our stakeholder is an app developer who needs data driven insights to determine on what type of app to build. 

## Tools
The primary tool I used for this analysis is SQL. This was a great project to practice some advance SQL queries.
